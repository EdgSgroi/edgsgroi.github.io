### About

<br/>
Formworks is a Open-Source framework licensed under the MIT license develped to facilitate the creation of forms on iOS aplications. Inspired by Server-driven UI, Formworks works using JSONs that describe all the components and characteristics of the form and set validation rules for each component using Regex. Formworks aims to be the simplest way to build usable forms.

I develped many parts of the framework, such as some parts of the UI, Components Validators, documentation, I also integrated the CI and Jazzy Action.
