        Projeta is an application for those looking to advertise or join academic projects throughout Brazil. With it you can create or ask to participate in projects that are of interest to you, as there are five types of categories supported. It is possible to easily view those projects in which you participate and manage your own projects, updating the requests for participation and the stage in which they are.
