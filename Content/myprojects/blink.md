### About

<br/>

<div>
Blink! is a tvOS app with a iOS companion, both developed using SwiftUI. In addition to the design, I developed all the communication between iOS and tvOS, using Multipeer Connectivity. With Blink! is possible to realize group brainstorming sessions on a AppleTV using iPhones to interaction.
