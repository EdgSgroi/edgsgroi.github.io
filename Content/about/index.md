# About

## I'm a developer who loves solving problems using the good Software Engineering.

Hello, my name is Edgar Sgroi and I'm a Brazilian <mark>iOS Develper</mark>. I built apps using <mark>MVC</mark> and <mark>MVVM</mark> using <mark>Coordinators</mark>. I worked on apps using <mark>UIKit</mark> and <mark>SwiftUI</mark>, some of them using <mark>View Coding</mark>, <mark>Sotryboard</mark> and <mark>XIB/NIB</mark>. Also, I have experience with <mark>Core Data</mark> and <mark>Cloud Kit</mark>, in addition with pulling data from <mark>APIs</mark> using <mark>URLSession</mark>. All of that using <mark>Software Engineering</mark> and concepts like <mark>Clean Architecture</mark>, keeping all testable and realizing as much tests as possible using <mark>XCTest</mark>.I'm very familiar with <mark>Agile</mark> development methods.
<br/>
Learn and share knowledge for me are important practices that I prioritize and I'm always searching people that prioritize it too. I'm passionate about software engineering and and all concepts envolving it.
